## Configuration for GitHub Actions

In order to use GitHub Actions in your repo, you'll need to first make a few configuration updates.

The actual [workflow](https://github.com/dcpesses/vite-react-ts-gh/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) can be found under [/.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)

### Build & Test

> Run on any branch

Build and test react app.

### Coverage Analysis

> Run on any branch

Run [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) analysis.

**Configuration**: <br>
[Create a Codecov token](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/quick-start#step-2-get-the-repository-upload-token) for your repo and add it as a `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret in your repo under Secrets and variables > Actions > Repository secrets.

### Deploy

> Run only on main branch (manual approve)

Deploy react app to GitHub Pages.

**Configuration**: <br>
- Replace `base` config in `vite.config.ts` to match your repo name
- Manual approve
  - If you want to keep it, you need to create a [new environment with manual approve](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/i-need-manual-approvers-for-github-actions-and-i-got-them-now/) in your repo, and then replace `environment` config of `deploy` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
    - `environment.name` = name of the environment created in your repo
    - `environment.url` = link to your github pages
  - If your want to remove it, just delete the `environment` config section of the `deploy` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Don't forget to [setup your repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch) to deploy from your GitHub Pages branch. (Defaults to `gh-pages` unless `publish_branch` is specified in the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` config.)

## GitHub Pages

There are additional modifications on `index.html`, and a new `404.html` file in the project to make it work well with GitHub Pages.
