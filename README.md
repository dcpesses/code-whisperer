*****

Developed as a way to help streamers thwart Jackbox trolls, this tool gives Twitch streamers the power to decide who can play in games they host by sending invites only to approved users.

> [!NOTE]
> Hey! This project is still actively in development and may be subject to change without notice. YMMV.

## Overview
<img src="/assets/screenshot.png" alt="app interface screenshot" align="right" width="25%" />
The app uses two queues, Interested and Playing, which allows a streamer to manage who will
be whispered. Users indicate if they want to join a game by entering commands in chat, which automatically adds them to the Interested queue. From there, the streamer can move users to and from the Playing queue; when a code is entered in the text form, all users in the Playing queue will be sent the code via a Twitch whisper.

### Features
- Sends game or lobby code to specific users by Twitch whisper (direct message)
- Can send to all users at once as well as individually
- Easy for users to join using commands in Twitch chat
- No additional login necessary from users willing to play
- Option to randomize user selection
- Set the Max # of Players via Dropdown
- NEW: Indicates if issues occur sending whispers
- More features coming soon...

### Caveats
- Users must be able to receive whispers
- App must remain open in an active browser window to receive commands
- Number of whispers sent is subject to [rate limits](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/#rate-limits)

### Chat Commands

#### User Commands:
* `!join` - Adds the user to the Interested queue
* `!new` - Adds the user to the Interested queue without notifying chat
* `!leave` - Removes the user from all queues
* `!version` - Posts the version of the app and its url
* `!whichpack GAME` - replies with the Jackbox Party Pack of a given game
* `!commands` - Lists all available commands
#### Mods / Streamer Commands:

* `!close` - Closes the Interested queue
* `!clear` - Removes all users from the queues
* `!clearopen` - Removes all users from the queues and reopens the Interested queue
* `!adduser @USER` - Adds specified user directly to Playing queue
